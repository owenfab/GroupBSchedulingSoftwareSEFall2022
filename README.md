## Important note about commits in this repository
In this repo, there are a lot of commits that are just "Delete ___" or "Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master'" and nothing else.
These commits are done either by Git automatically (in the case of "Merge remote-tracking...") or manually on GitHub itself by button press (in the case of "Delete...")
and as such do not require coding. 
<br> <br> 
There are long sequences of commits that are just "Delete..." due to our need to retool and "clean up" some parts of the repo, so these commits should not be considered
when tallying the amount of commits per group member per the stated reasons above.
